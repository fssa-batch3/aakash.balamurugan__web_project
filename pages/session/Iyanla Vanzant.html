           <p>Had a very positive experience working with Kate and KlearMinds. Kate was very easy to talk to and gave me space to do sessions in the way that worked best for me and I came out of them feeling refreshed and motivated. I would definitely recommend Kate to anyone looking to work through things in therapy, she was kind, thoughtful and always reliable even when I was a bit awkward about finding times that suited my schedule.</p>

        <p>Working with Deepak has been a really positive and transformative experience. She got what I needed straight away and through incisive but gentle questioning helped me change the way I think about so many things. If you are thinking about talking to a therapist, I would encourage you to go for it!</p>

      <p>I came across Mita and KlearMinds when I was going through a rough patch and needed someone to help and listen. Mita was phenomenal from the first meeting, always attentive, never judgmental and helped me with coping strategies to get me through such a difficult time. Looking back on it now I do not know how I would have got to where I am now without her support and would recommend KlearMinds and especially Mita to anyone in a similar position.</p>
